# Jenkins - Docker in Docker

Docker binaries installed on top of Jenkins for running Docker within pipelines.

Images for this repository are published to [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/mattsbanner/docker-jenkins-dind/packages/).

Currently, only the `latest` image is built, this is re-built nightly to keep up to date with the source Jenkins Docker image.
