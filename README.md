# Jenkins - Docker in Docker

Docker binaries installed on top of Jenkins for running Docker within pipelines.

Images for this repository are published to [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/mattsbanner/docker-jenkins-dind/packages/) and [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/mattbanner/jenkins-dind).

Currently, only the `latest` image is built, this is re-built nightly to keep up to date with the source Jenkins Docker image. Please create an [issue](https://github.com/mattsbanner/docker-jenkins-dind/issues) if you would like other versions built.
